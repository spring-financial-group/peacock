# mqube-go-cli-barebones
A template for creating Golang CLIs.

### Initial Setup
Once a new repo has been created from this template then a number of the files will need to be updated with the new repos name.
Find and replace all references to `mqube-go-cli-barebones` with the new repo name.

The `OWNERS` file may also need updating with any new reviewers. An approval on a PR from anyone in the file allows lighthouse
to automatically merge the PR once all the pipelines have succeeded.
